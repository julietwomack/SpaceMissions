# Introduction

This notebook is an exploratory analysis on the Kaggle dataset, "[All Space Missions from 1957](https://www.kaggle.com/agirlcoding/all-space-missions-from-1957)," using Python in Jupyter Notebook. The analysis utilizes the following Python libraries:

- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly
- Tabulate

The analysis is of personal interest to me due to my fascination with space exploration. In the analysis I attempt to utilize all columns of the data to create a comprehensive analysis of global space missions since 1957, which is the year the Sovient Union launched the first satellite into space, Sputnik [(archives.gov)](https://www.archives.gov/research/alic/reference/space-timeline.html).

# Key Takeaways

- The RVSN USSR and Russia have launched the most space missions since 1957.
    - The RVSN USSR has had 1,614 successful and 121 failed space missions.
- The United States has launched a comparative number of space missions to Russia (1,349 vs. 1,395), but the United States has had more failed missions compared to Russia (129 vs. 62) and less successful missions compared to Russia (1,186 vs. 1,303).
- After the 1990's Russia has decreased the number of space missions conducted. 
- Overtime the United States has stayed consistent with launching space missions.
    - Prior to 2020 China has risen as a contender in space exploration against the United States.
- China and the United States have the highest number of active rockets, 224 and 213, respectively.
- Only three countries, Austria, South Korea, and Kenya, do not currently have active rockets.
- 1971 was the biggest year for space exploration with 119 space missions conducted. In recent times, 2018 was the biggest year for space exploration with 117 space missions conducted.
    - 2018 also had the most successful space missions conducted, 113.
    - 1958 and 1960 had the most failed space missions, 20 each.
